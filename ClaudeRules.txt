Do not generate block comments for functions if they just repeat the function definition.
For example:

    /**
     * Logs an execution error to the database.
     * @param {ExecutionError} error - The error object containing error details
     * @param {string} [orderId] - Optional order ID associated with the error
     * @returns {Promise<ErrorRecord>} The created error record
     */
Should be removed completely as redundant. Everything said in the comment can be deduced from the function signature:

    async logError(error: ExecutionError, orderId?: string): Promise<ErrorRecord> {
        ...
    }
Do not generate single line comments that just "read" the line(s) of code following after.
For example:

    // Format size
    const formattedSize = this.formatNumber(parseFloat(orderParams.sz.toString()), szDecimals);
Should be without comment as it just regurgitates the variable name. Only comments that add non-trivial information (typically multiline) should be preserved.

Do not introduce single-use local variables - inline their definition instead.
For example:

    // Verify the message
    const isValid = await verifyMessage({
        address: checksummedAddress,
        message,
        signature: signature as `0x${ string }`,
    });
    
    return isValid;
Should just be (remember rule #2 about redundant one-line comments too):

    return await verifyMessage({
        address: checksummedAddress,
        message,
        signature: signature as `0x${string}`,
    });
Monitor for unused local/private variables and remove them if found.

General formatting rules:

use 4 spaces instead of tabs for indentation;
do not exceed 120 character per line of code;
try to keep function definitions and calls in one line if there is space.
